## WPF Game - Word War

I had to create a little **WPF** appliciation so I made this little game that I call Word War. I have got an improved version of this game which one is also use **REST API**. It is that kind of typing game where you have to type in the right world to get points. I did use REST API for the highscore, registration, login validation and for delete an account.
