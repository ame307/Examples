## Java Game - Have To Kill People

We learnt about the **clean coding**, **design patterns** so we had to represent our knowledge with a little java application. I know that we should to practice clean coding here but to be honest in the last 2 years I did not use java so I forgot a lot however I did this. I know it looks like wierd but I can explain that. I heard that sentence from a girl in youtube video where she played with an FPS game and It was so funny and I am a really bad designer so I needed some motivation. 

So we had to implement at least two pattern in this project. I used the **builder pattern** to build up those stickmans. It can be male or female and there is 4 style with each gender. They also have names but you can only see it in the logs. Yes, we had to log every action. The other pattern was the **prototype pattern** that I used for to display the weapons. I also had to use **MVVM** model and there is it. A little stress relief game.
