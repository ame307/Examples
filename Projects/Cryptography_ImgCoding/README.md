## Cryptography - Image Coding

We had a course about **Cryptography** and the teacher give up an optional task for better grade so I made it. I had to the write a program for encrypt messages with using the image pixels color code. I converted the message in an ascii code array and I changed the red color value with the amount of the ascii code value. After the encryption if we substract the the original pixels from the encrypted pixels the absolute value of the difference going to be the ascii code where the result is not zero. If I take these valuse and convert it back we got the original message.
